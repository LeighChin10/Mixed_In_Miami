<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

INTRODUCTION:

1- Who are we?
  First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this. This is Mixed in Miami, developed by a small group of student developers from Wyncode Academy. We seek to help drink enthusiasts who are interested in learning the art of cocktails by providing the resources of great drink recipes.

OUR APP:

As previously mentioned, our main objective is to help drink enthusiasts by providing a resourceful database of drink recipes. We have achieved this through our app Mixed in Miami, with the latest and up to date list of cocktails provided by TheCocktailDB.com API.

The main page contains a navigation bar: Home, About, Discover, and Search bar

The home page has a background mp4 video. 

The about page includes img elements for each team member with their name and their favorite drink.

The discover page directs you to the "Mix It Up!" button. This button will then populate a random drink pulling from the API listed under our routes folder, randomDrink.js. The purpose of this function is to enhance the user's knowledge by exposing them to new cocktails and showing all the information, such as the name of the drink, picture, ingredients and recipe.

 Lastly, the search bar allows the user to look up any drink by name, main ingredient and even auto populate suggestions. This is achieved by pulling from the API listed under routes folder, drinks.js. The results show similarly to the discover but with multiple results. 
 
The styling throughout the application is all done through react bootstrap.
