<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

OUR APP:

As previously mentioned, our main objective is to help any enthusiast of the art of cocktail making, by providing a resourceful database of recipes. We achieve this through our app Mixed in Miami (MiM), keeping up to date with the latest mixs and inventions of cocktails by the community.

As you enter the app, you are directed to the Home page which contains some general tabs as 'Home' ***;
an 'About us' page which will tell you a bit more about where we come from and how to get in contact with us;  a 'Categories' drop down meny which will display in a pop up tab the most popular alcohol types used in drink mixing and let you access them; we also have the 'search bar' which will allow to look up cocktail recipes by their names and access the ingredients and instructions on how to make it as well as a picture to better show what the drink looks like.
We have also included a special surprise with the 'Mix it Up' button which will randomly search through our database and output to the screen the selected cocktail and how to make it. This will give you the chance to be exposed to new cocktails and expand your bar repertoire at the same time.
